Q3. Why concurrency?

How can it make programming simpler?
- It allows for doing a task multiple times. 

How can it make it more difficult?
- More susceptible to errors due to interconnectivity of threads and sharing of variables
- More complicated programming

What are the differences between processes, threads, green threads, and fibers?
- Multiple threads can exist within a process, sharing resources
- Multiple processes do not share resources
- Green threads are those excuted in user space
- Fibers are cooperatively scheduled units and do not require a kernel (system level)


Which one of these do pthread_create() (C/POSIX), threading.Thread() (Python), go (Go) create?
- They create threads.

How does pythons  GIL influence the way a python Thread behaves?
- It acts like mutex. Bottleneck?

 What does func GOMAXPROCS(n int) int do?
- It limits the number of threads at user level. 


Q6. Four errors

Error! i is 4294967295
Error! i is 0
Error! i is -1

Two's complement?
